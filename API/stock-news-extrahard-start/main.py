## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

# Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

print(day_before_yesterday_closing_price)
# Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
difference = abs(float(yesterday_close_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing_price))

difference_percentage = (difference/float(yesterday_close_price))*100
print(difference_percentage)
#  If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
# if difference_percentage > 4:



## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

#  Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME

# Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: ttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation

data = news.json()["articles"][:3]


## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
formatted_news = [f"headline: {article['title']}. \nBrief: {article['description']}" for article in data]
print(formatted_news)
# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
